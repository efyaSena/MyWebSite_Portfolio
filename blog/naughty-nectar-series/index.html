       A Moment:— Heartless (In a Good Way)
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div class="nns-entry-text">
    <p>
      <strong>I AM HEARTLESS.!</strong><br>
      But in a good way…. I promise.<br>
      I’m fvcked up but you got no right to describe with your own words what you think you know about me out there.
    </p>

    <p>
      I trusted you.<br>
      I trusted that you keep me safe and have my back out there even if I meant little to you.
      Instead, you proved to me you were quite worse… and a little bit more than my ex and I have to stay away from you.
      We are the real definition of <em>“BAD FOR EACH OTHER!”</em>
    </p>

    <div class="nns-divider">****</div>

    <p>
      He picked me up by my collar from the couch we were seated.
      He dragged me to the edge of the window and as if obeying a command, I climbed up the window and waited for him up there.
      Lol weird huh.
    </p>

    <p>
      I turned to look over my shoulders and from his distance, I saw the way he looked at me…
      he wasn’t smiling at all but had his eyes squinted on my lips, staring so hard and biting on that lower lip a little bit harder.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could tell he was pretty dazed on some high.
      But on which high exactly? I had no idea.
      Drug sex?
      You should experience some molly, herb, snow and alcohol experience with your favorite person,
      just to feel this connection I’m talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      He held onto his little dresser and climbed up behind me.
      Brought his lips closest to my ears and almost like a whisper —
      <em>“hi baby…”</em><br>
      He let out my favourite phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
      He sensed the chills from every pore of my body.
      Right from my spine to the tip of my toes.
      He began to slowly wine his waist behind me.
      Setting me up for the mood.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“How do you feel when I feel you from behind?”</em><br>
      He asked under a hot breath, behind my ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      His one hand in between my legs now and his other hand hanging on the window frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“I’m feeling a bit warm inside and chilled all over,”</em>
      I whispered slowly, pretty light and feeling overwhelmed just by the mere thought of his body pressed onto mine on top of his window.
      Lol.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“Talk to me… how do I really make you feel?”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      He asked me again with his fingers rushing deep and in circles inside my pussy.
      And as I wined and grind and moved my waist up and down, I hanged on to the window as well,
      as if holding on for dear life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could feel my soul departing from my body even though my grip on the window was firm and adjusted right in its corners.
      With my mouth slightly open and barely speaking, I opened my eyes and —
      <em>“yessssss…!”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“Yh..?”</em> he asked, digging in a bit deeper and faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like how I like it.
      Some aggression.
      Some heat.
      Some wilderness.
      And some connection that’s never been felt.
    </p>

    <p>
      And as if from nowhere he moved his hand from his side of the window onto my left hand
      and it felt like a circle in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      From my mind to my lips,
      to his lips on my ears with hot breaths.
      From my back pressed into his chest,
      to my waist stuck on his,
      and his handy work in between my thighs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I felt his smile from behind me.
      <em>“You must be enjoying this huh?”</em> I asked in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      And just like fate ordained, he responded out loud —
      <strong>“I enjoy fvckn you.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      How we come up with these positions, trust me, I had no idea.
      All I knew was, I was ready to explore it all with this particular niqqa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sad he is married and taken off the market….
      If wishes were truly horse, I would definitely place my bet on this one…..

    <article class="writing-post">
  <h2 class="writing-title">TRAPPED.</h2>

  <div class="writing-body">
   <p>
I walked into the room — all four corners white, quiet, clean as snow.
</p>

<p>
Gently, I stepped forward. Slowly. One foot at a time.
I let the tiny cover cloth fall from my body.
</p>

<p>
Slowly.  
Carefully.  
Each step deliberate.
</p>

<p>
The cloth slid away, exposing the pointed, standing ovations on my chest,
jiggling softly in rhythm with my movement.
</p>

<p>
In the center of the room sat a bathtub — filled with fresh lime-grey water,
still, waiting.
</p>

<p>
As I approached, a chilly, seductive breeze touched my face,
caressing my skin, awaken something buried deep inside me.
</p>

<p>
The desire to want.  
The hunger for touch.  
The pleasure of grabbing, scratching — maybe even screaming.  
The need to coil underneath.
</p>

<p>
The yearning for warm juices to seep out,
slow and shameless, across trembling skin.
</p>

<p>
I stared at my faded reflection in the tub.
</p>

<p>
One foot slid into the lime juice.
</p>

<p>
The sourness stung my skin and hit a nerve, alive with ecstasy.
My eyes shut tight.
</p>

<p>
Then the second leg.
Gently — almost obediently — I lowered myself into the bath.
</p>

<p>
A drop of blood fell from the cut on my left wrist,
 into the water, splashing back onto my hand. I winced.
</p>

<p>
Pain.  
Pleasure.  
Ache.  
Burn.
</p>

<p>
My dry throat pushed my tongue out,
landing on lips that tasted sweet and sour
</p>

<p>
I relaxed now.
I closed my eyes again.
</p>

<p>
My legs folded.  
Flesh pressed against flesh.
</p>

<p>
I wanted this.
</p>

<p>
The sweetness of pain on my wrist.  
The sour bite of lime on my skin.  
The wildness burning on my lips.
</p>

<p>
Yes — the pain, because it made me feel alive.  
Yes — the sourness, because it reminded me how dull and boring your life was without me.  
And yes — the wildness, because that’s what you always did to me.
</p>


<p>
Then in goes —
</p>

<p>
One finger.  
Then two.
</p>

<p> Slowly,
My body drifted, numbing.
My mind dark and moody.
My heart satisfied.
My soul draining.
</p>

<p>
Fingers moving faster.
Lips parting.
Sound dissolving.
</p>

<p>
I bit down hard on my lower lip —
and yes —
I let it out.
</p>

<p>
Everything splashed against the water,
against my skin.
</p>

<p>
Sweet pain flared between my legs.
I tried to lift myself — slipped —
and my wounded hand plunged back into the bath.
</p>

<p>
I screamed!.
</p>

<p>
It felt like overwhelming,
when all I wanted was to release.
</p>

<p>
To free a troubled mind.
To wring out a heavy, aching body.
</p>

<p>
I couldn’t get out.
My body failed me.
</p>

<p>
My hands went numb.
My head grew light.
Sounds echoed.
My heart raced.
</p>

<p>
Regret crept in — slow and regreting now.
</p>

<p>
The fantasy I craved
turned into an agonizing trap.
</p>

<p>
The last thing I saw was you —
screaming my name,
struggling to pull me from the tub.
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
</p>

<p>
Not because you came saved me —
but because you couldn’t lift this thickness,this heavy embodiment
you once took for granted.
</p>

<p>
You had to drag me out instead.
You never could handle me anyway.
</p>

<p>
I smiled…
and finally let go —
knowing the guilt you’d carry
if anything happened to me.
</p>

<p>
Then I woke up.
</p>

<p>
Blue walls.
Hospital corners.
Stitches in my hands.
An oversized gown clinging to a body
that no longer felt mine.
For a second,
I thought this was the afterlife.
</p>

<p>
when my eyes were clearly opened,
</p>

<p>
And there you were.
</p>

<p>
I shut them close.
Turned my back to you —
annoyed,
disgusted —
at the sound of your voice calling my name.
</p>

<p>
A new voice cut in,
telling you to let me rest.
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
I knew you felt that —
standing there,
staring at my back.
</p>

<p>
Manipulating you became my weapon.
One you handed me
the moment you dropped me like nothing.
</p>

<p>
I slept on.

    <p>
      Some truths don’t arrive gently.  
      They come loud, messy, and unapologetic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STORY BODY -->
  <div class="writing-body">

    <p>
      Yh — it’s ok to be a whore, he was told one time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe it was ok for her. That was her truth. She lived it.
      He saw her happy in it — actually happy — and that thought stayed with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was freaky. Spoilt. Nasty. And oh — sike.
      He tried to hide that side of himself behind filters, behind explanations,
      behind the version of himself people found easier to swallow.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      But the truth?
    </p>

    <p class="pull-quote">
      Once the switch flipped, he was worse than a whore.  
      <span class="hot">He was a monster.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      And this time, he decided to live it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why did he always need to be the good one?
      Why explain himself until exhaustion?
      Why pretend just to be liked?
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      This time, he chose himself.
    </p>

    <ul class="writing-list">
      <li>Drink what he wanted.</li>
      <li>Smoke what he wanted.</li>
      <li>Live the life he deemed fit.</li>
      <li>Build a body he felt comfortable in.</li>
      <li>And mostly — stay silent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Silence was golden.  
      Shutting people out was peace.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      You’re bad — so what?  
      You’re a monster — so what?
    </p>

    <p>
      At least he was living his truth.
      Trying to outlive a life he never asked for.
      They had nothing in common anyway.
    </p>

    <p class="pull-quote">
      Everyone is a little <span class="hot">fucked up</span>.  
      You just have to find someone whose demons play well with yours.
    </p>

    <hr class="story-break" />

    <p>
      Just as the questions and fragments of stories piled up in his mind,
      he sipped on his juice and smiled at his friends at the far end of the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then he turned — and frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were carrying her upstairs.
      Drunk. Pilled up. Giggling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever they planned to do to her would be a nightmare —
      the kind of trauma that never really leaves.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      But did they care?
    </p>

    <p>
      They were fucked up too.
      He wondered if they even knew what they were doing —
      or if any of it would survive the morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Someone tripped. Her head hit the door.
      Fuck.
    </p>

    <p>
      He followed them upstairs.
      Maybe to make sure she was okay.
      Maybe curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yo bro, you coming up?”
      One of them called out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Did he really think Kai was one of them?
    </p>

    <p>
      She’d been talking shit all night — about how she could take all of them.
      They laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of them smacked her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ouch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kai locked eyes with her.
      She smiled.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      Oh — you know exactly what you’re doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      He smiled back.
      A baddie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t mind these fools.
      They’re horny. High. Clueless.
      They don’t know how to appreciate a good thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      She laughed — high pitched.
      It pissed one of them off.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You know her?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Nah.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kai walked back to the corner, sipping his juice,
      preparing for the show.
    </p>

    <p>
      Four of them.
      Pants down.
      Smiling.
      Waiting.
    </p>

    <p>
      She dropped to all fours.
      Drunk but steady.
      Arching her back low, ass high —
      pink lips parting as her thong slid between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of them busted early.
      They laughed as he ran out holding himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kai locked the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wouldn’t want interruptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      She caught his eyes in the mirror.
      Smiling.
      Teasing.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      You that good?
    </p>

    <p>
      He sat behind her.
      She kept laughing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Was she even feeling them?
    </p>

    <p>
      The angriest one finally went in.
      She moaned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kai laughed.
      Trash.
    </p>

    <p>
      “If you think you better, why don’t you pull your dick out?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kai dropped his cup.
      Took off his jacket.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      Showtime.
    </p>

    <p>
      He ignored everyone else.
      Smiled at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was his performance.
      A lifetime one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lights on.
      They stepped back.
    </p>

    <p>
      She parted her lips for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      He moved slow.
      Eye contact.
      Biting his lip.
    </p>

    <p>
      She stopped smiling.
      Let out a breath.
    </p>

    <p>
      He smirked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rest followed exactly how he planned.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      And this?
    </p>

    <p class="pull-quote">
      This was only the beginning.

       Desire doesn’t always scream.

  <!-- STORY BODY -->
  <div class="writing-body">

    <p>She stepped out of the club to catch some fresh air.</p>

    <p>
      She paused and stared at the couple leaning on the car, tongues tangled in each other’s mouths,
      hands everywhere else. Drunk much?
    </p>

    <p>
      She stared a little too long and thought to herself,
      <span class="hot">wait… hold up… is that—?</span>
      Oh well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lady in question was none other than Cilia —
      yeah, the only bitch she ever left with an attitude.
      And the reason?
      Right there.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      What bothered her most wasn’t even the sight — it was the nerve it struck.
    </p>

    <p>
      She frowned and shifted her gaze, only for it to land on someone walking toward her.
      She wished the ground would open up and do its fucking worst.
    </p>

    <p>
      He got closer.
      She turned to walk away, but he grabbed her arm before she could cross the road
      back to her friends.
    </p>

    <p class="dialogue">“Heyyyy…”</p>

    <p>
      “What do you want?” she asked dryly, trying hard not to look into his dreamy eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      His eyes were thirsty — not for her, she guessed.
      She’d seen how he was with the other girls earlier.
      For a moment, whatever they had shared didn’t feel special anymore.
    </p>

    <p class="dialogue">“I can’t get a hug?”</p>

    <p>
      The question snapped her back.
      She looked into his smoky eyes and felt anger rush in —
      sharp, fast, straight to her chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her gaze dropped to his lips.
      And she lost it.
    </p>

    <p class="dialogue">“Mmmhmm?”</p>

    <p>
      His voice made everything worse.
      She was fuming — but when he pulled her in for a hug and kissed her neck,
      she knew exactly how fucked she’d be if she didn’t pull away.
    </p>

    <p>
      And she did.
    </p>

    <p class="pull-quote">
      She knew what his mouth and tongue could do — and she refused to let herself forget it.
    </p>

    <p>
      She wanted to go home with her friends.
      Sleep alone in her bed.
      Anything was better than getting a room with his toxic ass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truth was, she almost jumped him behind the car.
      Almost.
    </p>

    <p>
      But three days earlier, during their argument,
      he’d told her to <span class="hot">“fuck off”</span>
      because she got busy and didn’t have time for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      And she did.
      Fucked off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getting him off her radar was going to prove a point — sooner or later.
    </p>

    <p>
      She looked him in the eyes and told him she had to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her friends waved from across the street.
      Their ride was in.
      They’d given her enough time with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      As much as she wanted him —
      as much as she wanted to ditch them for him —
      she shook her head.
    </p>

    <p>
      She frowned.
      Rolled her eyes.
      Leaned in for one last hug.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not to stay.
      Just to smell him.
      To feel his skin.
      To hear his breath against her ear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she pushed him away and walked out.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      She didn’t care how obvious it looked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone watching could read it —
      the want,
      the tension,
      the almost.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were probably shocked she left him standing there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Walking away from the alcohol and the highs of the night,
      she felt him calling out to her silently.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yes — she wanted to turn back.
      Run back into his arms, and
      Kiss the hell out of him.
    </p>

    <p class="beat">
      But she didn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
      The disrespect was too loud.
      And this time,she wants to wait.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weeks, if needed.
      Until a proper apology came out of his mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until then, they were nothing but a hello and a hi.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a fight she was willing to train herself for.
    </p>

    <p class="closing-line">
      He’d get his way.
      <br />
      But so would she this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      She slid into the back seat of the car with her friends, and the teasing started immediately — name-calling, laughter, side-eyes.

The girls didn’t let up all the way to the next party.
