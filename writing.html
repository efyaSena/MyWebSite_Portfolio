      Episode 01 — Heartless (In a Good Way)
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div class="nns-entry-text">
    <p>
      <strong>I AM HEARTLESS.!</strong><br>
      But in a good way…. I promise.<br>
      I’m fvcked up but you got no right to describe with your own words what you think you know about me out there.
    </p>

    <p>
      I trusted you.<br>
      I trusted that you keep me safe and have my back out there even if I meant little to you.
      Instead, you proved to me you were quite worse… and a little bit more than my ex and I have to stay away from you.
      We are the real definition of <em>“BAD FOR EACH OTHER!”</em>
    </p>

    <div class="nns-divider">****</div>

    <p>
      He picked me up by my collar from the couch we were seated.
      He dragged me to the edge of the window and as if obeying a command, I climbed up the window and waited for him up there.
      Lol weird huh.
    </p>

    <p>
      I turned to look over my shoulders and from his distance, I saw the way he looked at me…
      he wasn’t smiling at all but had his eyes squinted on my lips, staring so hard and biting on that lower lip a little bit harder.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could tell he was pretty dazed on some high.
      But on which high exactly? I had no idea.
      Drug sex?
      You should experience some molly, herb, snow and alcohol experience with your favorite person,
      just to feel this connection I’m talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      He held onto his little dresser and climbed up behind me.
      Brought his lips closest to my ears and almost like a whisper —
      <em>“hi baby…”</em><br>
      He let out my favourite phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
      He sensed the chills from every pore of my body.
      Right from my spine to the tip of my toes.
      He began to slowly wine his waist behind me.
      Setting me up for the mood.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“How do you feel when I feel you from behind?”</em><br>
      He asked under a hot breath, behind my ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      His one hand in between my legs now and his other hand hanging on the window frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“I’m feeling a bit warm inside and chilled all over,”</em>
      I whispered slowly, pretty light and feeling overwhelmed just by the mere thought of his body pressed onto mine on top of his window.
      Lol.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“Talk to me… how do I really make you feel?”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      He asked me again with his fingers rushing deep and in circles inside my pussy.
      And as I wined and grind and moved my waist up and down, I hanged on to the window as well,
      as if holding on for dear life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could feel my soul departing from my body even though my grip on the window was firm and adjusted right in its corners.
      With my mouth slightly open and barely speaking, I opened my eyes and —
      <em>“yessssss…!”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“Yh..?”</em> he asked, digging in a bit deeper and faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just like how I like it.
      Some aggression.
      Some heat.
      Some wilderness.
      And some connection that’s never been felt.
    </p>

    <p>
      And as if from nowhere he moved his hand from his side of the window onto my left hand
      and it felt like a circle in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      From my mind to my lips,
      to his lips on my ears with hot breaths.
      From my back pressed into his chest,
      to my waist stuck on his,
      and his handy work in between my thighs.
    </p>

    <p>
      I felt his smile from behind me.
      <em>“You must be enjoying this huh?”</em> I asked in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      And just like fate ordained, he responded out loud —
      <strong>“I enjoy fvckn you.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      How we come up with these positions, trust me, I had no idea.
      All I knew was, I was ready to explore it all with this particular niqqa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sad he is married and taken off the market….
      If wishes were truly horse, I would definitely place my bet on this one…..
